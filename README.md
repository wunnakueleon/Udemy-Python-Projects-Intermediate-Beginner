The projects from this repository include the majority of the projects from Dr.Angela's Udemy Python course.
They showcase the growth in my understanding of coding and programming in Python.
Ranging from 'Hello World' to 'Snake Game' and 'Pond Game', I have gone through the good intricate part of the beginning stage of programming.
These projects are testimonies to my commitment to coding and my fervent passion for this.
